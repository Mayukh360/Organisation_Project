## Overview

This project is structured to handle various routes with Prisma for database schema definition, and GraphQL for API definitions and resolvers. The project is organized into distinct folders for schema definitions, routes, mutations, and resolvers.

 Folder Structure

1. `schema.prisma`
This folder contains the Prisma schema definition for the database tables.

#### `schema.prisma`
- **Purpose:** Defines the database schema using Prisma.
- **Content:** All tables, fields, and relationships for the database.

 2. `routes`
This folder contains all the route definitions, including types, mutations, and queries.

#### `routes/account`
This subfolder handles account-related operations.

##### `index.graphql`
- **Purpose:** Declares GraphQL types, mutations, and queries for account-related operations.
- **Content:**
  - **Types:** Definitions for account-related data structures.
  - **Mutations:** Declarations for operations that modify account-related data.
  - **Queries:** Declarations for operations that fetch account-related data.

##### `__mutation__`
- **Purpose:** Contains all mutation functions for account-related operations.
- **Content:**
  - **createAccount:** Mutation to create a new account.
  - **updateAccount:** Mutation to update an existing account.
  - **deleteAccount:** Mutation to delete an account.

##### `__resolver__`
- **Purpose:** Contains all resolver functions for account-related queries and mutations.
- **Content:**
  - **Account:** Resolver for account-related queries.
  - **Queries:** Functions to fetch account-related data.
  - **Mutations:** Functions to modify account-related data, linking to mutations in `__mutation__`.


 3. `routes/otherRoutes`
This subfolder can include other routes similar to the `account` folder, each with its own `index.graphql`, `__mutation__`, and `__resolver__`.

## Example Documentation for Another Route

#### `routes/otherRoute`
This subfolder handles otherRoute-related operations.

##### `index.graphql`
- **Purpose:** Declares GraphQL types, mutations, and queries for otherRoute-related operations.
- **Content:**
  - **Types:** Definitions for otherRoute-related data structures.
  - **Mutations:** Declarations for operations that modify otherRoute-related data.
  - **Queries:** Declarations for operations that fetch otherRoute-related data.

##### `__mutation__`
- **Purpose:** Contains all mutation functions for otherRoute-related operations.
- **Content:**
  - **createOtherRoute:** Mutation to create a new otherRoute.
  - **updateOtherRoute:** Mutation to update an existing otherRoute.
  - **deleteOtherRoute:** Mutation to delete an otherRoute.

##### `__resolver__`
- **Purpose:** Contains all resolver functions for otherRoute-related queries and mutations.
- **Content:**
  - **OtherRoute:** Resolver for otherRoute-related queries.
  - **Queries:** Functions to fetch otherRoute-related data.
  - **Mutations:** Functions to modify otherRoute-related data, linking to mutations in `__mutation__`.
